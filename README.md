        <h1>Hi, my Yellow,</h1>
        <p>Sorry for interrupting, but I just wanted to remind you that you are deeply appreciated. Please don't hurt yourself with the negative thoughts that may come into your mind. Never think that I will leave you—especially when we finally meet. Know that nothing will change between us. I want you to always remember that I accept you for who you are, so don’t feel insecure. If only you could see yourself through my eyes, you would realize just how beautiful you truly are.</p>
        <p>Please take care of your mental health as well. Don’t let negative thoughts overpower you. I will always be by your side whenever you feel alone or when it seems like the world is against you. Even if others aren't there, remember that I am. We will face any challenge the world throws at us, together. We will live and grow side by side.</p>
        <p>Before I end this letter, I want to remind you that I will always pursue you, no matter what happens. I know how much pain your past has caused you, and I will never let it repeat. I won’t allow anyone to hurt you again the way they did before.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,<br>Aizen</p>
